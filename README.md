OpenCamp
========

We're [RailsMN](http://rails.mn) and helping people learn Rails by building OpenCamp, the free & open source version of [BaseCamp](http://basecamp.com/), a project management application. 

### Instructions  
We've compiled instructions for how we incrementally built OpenCamp here, [open_camp sessions](https://github.com/railsmn/schedule/tree/master/open_camp).  

### Dev Environment
We've also created a simple Rails Development environment (so you don't have to spend hours installing and setting up Rails). Check it out, [railsmn-dev-box](https://github.com/railsmn/railsmn-dev-box).  

### Feedback  
We'd love your feedback. [Open an issue](https://github.com/railsmn/open_camp/issues), or reach out to the RailsMN organizers, [@derekrockwell](https://twitter.com/derekrockwell) or [@westonplatter](http://twitter.com/westonplatter)

More to come later!
